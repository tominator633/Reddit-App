# Reddit.to.read

[Reddit.to.read](https://reddittoread.netlify.app) is a web-based application allowing user to browse posts based on subreddits from Reddit social network without having to create a Reddit account.

>[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a social media platform where users can share, discuss, and vote on content in the form of posts, links, and comments. Itâ€™s organized into subreddits, which are individual communities focused on specific topics, such as news, hobbies, entertainment, or niche interests. Each subreddit has its own rules and moderators, allowing for diverse conversations and content tailored to its subject matter.

I built this app as a required project at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) learning platform. My goal was to create a cleaner version of Reddit, where the user can only READ the content based on their preferred subreddits.
Therefore, [Reddit JSON API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/json)
has been used to obtain data and only GET requests are executed when using Reddit.to.read app.
