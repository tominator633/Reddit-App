# Reddit.to.read

[Reddit.to.read](https://reddittoread.netlify.app) is a web-based application allowing user to browse posts based on subreddits from Reddit social network without having to create a Reddit account.

>[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a social media platform where users can share, discuss, and vote on content in the form of posts, links, and comments. Itâ€™s organized into subreddits, which are individual communities focused on specific topics, such as news, hobbies, entertainment, or niche interests. Each subreddit has its own rules and moderators, allowing for diverse conversations and content tailored to its subject matter.

I built this app as a required project at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) learning platform. My goal was to create a cleaner version of Reddit, where the user can only READ the content based on their preferred subreddits.
Therefore, [Reddit JSON API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/json)
has been used to obtain data and only GET requests are executed when using Reddit.to.read app.




## Initial setup
Reddit.to.read can be found under this [LINK](https://reddittoread.netlify.app).
After opening the link , the application is ready to be used. The feed of popular reddits is displayed initially.

## App layout
The app is structured as follows:

### Browsing reddit posts

Reddit posts (Reddits) for various topics show up after clicking on different subreddits on the swiper next to the app logo. 
Popular is the first navigation link on the swiper, serves to display the most popular current reddits worldwide and cannot be removed.
The next links are subreddits from My Subreddits selection and serve to render reddits of various topics accordingly.

#### Reddit

Each Reddit is composed of 3 columns. 

* The left column shows the number of votes it received from registered users on Reddit social network.
* The middle column displays 
the author of the post with a hyperlink to their profile on Reddit.com.
The relative timestamp of when the post was created.
The title of the post
The content of the post, such as text, a picture, a video or a link.
* The right column involves 3 buttons:
    - Comments section button
    - Hyperlink to the post on Reddit.com
    - Save button

### Displaying comments for a particular reddit

After clicking the comment section button in the right column of a Reddit post, a Comments window appears, with basic information about the posts and the comments. Each comments has its votes and can also have replies, which are rendered after clicking on the replies button.

### Saving reddits

Each Reddit can be saved by clicking its save button located in the right column
Those reddits are then added to Saved Reddits section of the app, accessed by the respective button on the right side of the app header.
The number within the button's icon represents the amount of currently saved Reddits.
Everytime a reddit is saved, its save button changes to a blue unsave button.

### Searching in current reddits

Everytime some reddits are displayed in the app, the search button located on the right side of the app header can be used to search those reddits.
The search bar appears after clicking the search button and accepts one or more keywords. Those keywords are analyzed only for the reddit TITLES, not for the selftext or authors.
The search button disappears everytime the subreddits manager is accessed or when the Saved reddits section is accessed without any reddits saved.
