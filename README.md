# Reddit.to.read

[Reddit.to.read](https://reddittoread.netlify.app) is a web-based application allowing user to browse posts based on subreddits from Reddit social network without having to create a Reddit account.

>[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a social media platform where users can share, discuss, and vote on content in the form of posts, links, and comments. Itâ€™s organized into subreddits, which are individual communities focused on specific topics, such as news, hobbies, entertainment, or niche interests. Each subreddit has its own rules and moderators, allowing for diverse conversations and content tailored to its subject matter.

I built this app as a required project at [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) learning platform. My goal was to create a cleaner version of Reddit, where the user can only READ the content based on their preferred subreddits.
Therefore, [Reddit JSON API](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/json)
has been used to obtain data and only GET requests are executed when using Reddit.to.read app.




## Initial setup
Reddit.to.read can be found under this [LINK](https://reddittoread.netlify.app).
After opening the link , the application is ready to be used. The feed of popular reddits is displayed initially.

## App layout
The app is structured as follows:

## Features

### Subreddits management
Subreddits displayed in **SWIPER** can be changed depending on user`s interests. Clicking **_SUBREDDITS MANAGER BUTTON_** launches a page with 2 sections:

#### 1. My Subreddits selection

* **_SWIPER subreddits buttons_** in the header of the app always correspond to the subreddits in **My Subreddits selection**.

#### 2. Explore subreddits
![Explore subreddits structure](./public/readme-img/explore-subreddits.png)

* This section has a **_search input field_** to search subreddits in Reddit database based on one or more given keywords
* A rounded **_search submit button_** with magnifier icon only appears when the **_search input field_** is not empty
* After inputting a search query and clicking the **_search submit button_**, a request for subreddits is sent and results appear below.
* Subreddit boxes in search results can be added to **My Subreddits selection** by clicking their **_plus button_**, located on the same place as delete button of already added subreddits

### Browsing reddit posts

Reddit posts (Reddits) for various topics show up after clicking on different subreddits on the swiper next to the app logo. 
**_popular_** is the first navigation link on the swiper, serves to display the most popular current reddits worldwide and cannot be removed.
The next links are subreddits from **My Subreddits selection** and serve to display reddits of various topics accordingly.

#### Reddit

Each Reddit is composed of 3 columns as follows:
![reddit structure](./public/readme-img/reddit.png)

* The left column shows the number of votes it received from registered users on Reddit social network.
* The middle column displays 
the author of the post with a **_hyperlink to their profile_** on Reddit.com.
The relative timestamp of when the post was created.
The title of the post
The content of the post, such as text, a picture, a video or a link.
* The right column involves 3 buttons:
    - **_Comments section button_**
    - **_Hyperlink_** to the post on Reddit.com
    - **_Save button_**

### Displaying comments for a particular reddit

After clicking the **_comment section button_** in the right column of a Reddit post, a **Comments window** appears, with some basic information about the posts and the comments themselves. Each comments has its votes and can also have replies, which are rendered after clicking the replies button.

### Saving reddits

Each Reddit can be saved by clicking its **_save button_** located in the right column
Those reddits are then added to **Saved Reddits section** of the app, accessed by the respective button on the right side of the app header.
The number within the button's icon represents the amount of currently saved Reddits.
Everytime a reddit is saved, its **_save button_** changes to a blue **_unsave button_**.

### Searching in current reddits

Everytime some reddits are displayed in the app, the **_search button_** located on the right side of the app header can be used to search those reddits.
The **_search bar_** appears after clicking the **_search button_** and accepts one or more keywords. Those keywords are analyzed only for the reddit **TITLES**, not for the selftext or authors.
The **_search button_** disappears everytime the subreddits manager is accessed or when the Saved reddits section is accessed without any reddits saved.

## Utilized technologies
* **React JS** - Reddit.to.read is a single-page react application with function components as the main building elements. React router manages the navigation and URL structures.
* **CSS** - styles for components are written in css modules.
* **JSX, HTML** - to mark up the content.
* **Redux** - used as a state management tool, primarily to fetch and store arrays of requested content such as posts, comments, subreddits, etc.
* **Framer motion** - for animations, such as entering and exiting items in the app, layout animations.
* **Jest and Enzyme** - for unit and integration tests.
* **MarkdownIt, DOMpurify** - to translate and sanitize markdown text of posts and comments to HTML.
* **dash.js** - to establish a media player for videos of reddits posts based on their dash URL and thus enable video sound in this app.
